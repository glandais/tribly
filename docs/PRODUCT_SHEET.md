## Positioning

Primary market: France (French is the default language). The decision-makers are club presidents,
ride organizers and team administrators.

### Personas

| Persona | Cares about | Challenge | Value we promise |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Club Admin | Growing membership, smooth operations | Managing multiple communication channels, keeping members engaged | Centralized platform for all club activities |
| Ride Organizer | Safe, well-organized rides | Coordinating groups, sharing routes, tracking participation | Easy ride creation with groups, routes, and participant management |
| Club Member | Finding rides that match their level | Knowing which rides suit their fitness, getting routes on GPS | Clear group info, easy registration, one-click GPS sync |

**Anti-persona:** Solo cyclists who ride alone and don't need group coordination.

### Problems & Pain Points

**Core problem:** Cycling clubs struggle to organize rides across multiple tools (WhatsApp, email, Strava, spreadsheets).

**Why alternatives fall short:**
- WhatsApp/Facebook: No route management, no structured ride info, messages get lost
- Strava: Individual-focused, not designed for club coordination
- Spreadsheets: Manual, no GPS integration, poor mobile experience

**What it costs them:** Missed rides, confusion about meeting points, riders showing up to the wrong group.

**Emotional tension:** Frustration for organizers, anxiety for new members unsure which group to join.

### Switching Dynamics

- **Push:** Frustration with fragmented tools, messages getting lost, route sharing hassles
- **Pull:** Integrated platform, GPS sync, professional club presence
- **Habit:** Existing WhatsApp groups, familiarity with current tools
- **Anxiety:** Learning curve, getting all members to switch

The French product vocabulary (sortie, parcours, étape…) is in the editorial lexicon of
