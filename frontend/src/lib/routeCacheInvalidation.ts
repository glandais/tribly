/**
 * Invalidates every cached view of a team's routes that a route mutation (create, update, delete,
 * undelete, slug change, GPX upload) can have changed: the routes list, the single-route detail
 * (when the mutation targets one route — pass its *previous* slug on a slug change), and every
 * `/routes/bulk` query for the team.
 *
 * `/routes/bulk` (`getGetRoutesBulkQueryKey`) is keyed on its own params (slug set, geometry) —
 * a query key disjoint from the single-route key's prefix, so react-query's partial
 * matching never reaches it by invalidating the single-route key alone. A bulk query result can
 * hold any slug set (a ride's groups, a trip's stages, a map view), so there's no cheaper correct
 * granularity than invalidating every bulk query of the team — done here by invalidating the key
 * without params, which react-query partial-matches against every params variant.
 *
 * Call this from every route mutation's `onSuccess` instead of invalidating
 * `getGetRouteQueryKey`/`getListRoutesQueryKey` by hand, so a future mutation can't forget the
 * bulk key.
