/**
 * Exchange the incoming `refresh_token` cookie for an access token, so the rest of the render can
 * call the API as the visitor rather than anonymously.
 *
 * One call per document request, and only when a cookie is actually present. The result is a bearer
 * token used for every prefetch — the raw cookie is never relayed, because the backend's cookie
 * fallback only authenticates `@PermitAll` endpoints while a bearer token behaves exactly like the
 * browser's, which is what keeps server-rendered DTOs identical to the client's.
 *
 * Any failure returns undefined and the page renders anonymously, exactly as it did before SSR
 * became session-aware. A revoked or expired token is the normal case here, not an incident.
 *
 * Note on migration: sessions created before the cookie moved to `path=/` are invisible here (the
 * browser does not send them on a document request). Those renders stay anonymous until the client's
 * own `/api/auth/refresh` call re-issues the cookie on the new path — from the next navigation on,
 * SSR sees it. No reconnection required.
