 * Wraps MapLibre's own control for one reason: `MapStyleDto.attribution` — the credit a provider
 * ships *no* attribution for, IGN's `PLAN.IGN` being the case that exists — has to be passed as
 * `customAttribution`, and MapLibre only reads that when the control is constructed. Hence the
 * `key`: changing basemap rebuilds the control instead of leaving the previous provider credited.
 * Everything else (OpenStreetMap, CyclOSM, Esri, Géoportail, VersaTiles, the Mapterhorn DEM) comes
 * from the style document itself and needs nothing from us.
 *
 * A map that renders third-party tiles renders this. It is not a detail of taste: ODbL, Esri's terms
 * and IGN's all require the credit to be visible next to the tiles they apply to.
