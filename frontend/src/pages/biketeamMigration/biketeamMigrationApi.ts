/**
 * The two calls of the biketeam migration page, written by hand: the endpoints are hidden from the
 * OpenAPI contract (a one-off feature only this page calls), so Orval generates nothing for them.
 * They go through `axiosMutator` like the generated clients, so a failure still arrives as an
 * `ApiClientError` carrying the `BIKETEAM_*` code.
 *
 * The types mirror the Java DTOs in backend/src/main/java/fr/pedalons/dto/migration/ and the enums
 * BiketeamMigrationTargetState / BiketeamMigrationBlockReason — field for field; keep them in step.
 *
 * See docs/plans/2026-09-22-biketeam-live-migration.md §4 and §12.2.
