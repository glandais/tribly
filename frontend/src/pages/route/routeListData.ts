 * `pages/ride/rideDetailData.ts` — its own module so `routes.config.ts`, which imports it eagerly,
 * doesn't pull the page out of its lazy chunk.
 *
 * The filters are the reason this matters more here than on a detail page: the list's query key is
 * derived from the query string, so the page and the prefetch have to read the URL through the
 * *same* schema and alias, and turn it into API params the *same* way. Spelled out twice, a
 * filtered URL server-renders one list and then silently refetches another after hydration.
