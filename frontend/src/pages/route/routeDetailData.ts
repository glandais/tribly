/**
 * The one description of what the route detail screen reads, consumed two ways: `RouteDetailPage`
 * calls {@link useRouteDetailData} for the query results, the `route-detail` route in
 * `routes.config.ts` calls {@link prefetchRouteDetail} for the same data server-side. Same contract
 * as `pages/ride/rideDetailData.ts` — its own module so `routes.config.ts`, which imports it
 * eagerly, doesn't pull the page (or its lazy chunk) out of its bundle.
 *
 * `route-map` (`RouteFullscreenMapPage`) is a strict subset of this screen — team + route, no
 * usages, no comments, no GPS services — so it reuses the same two calls via
 * {@link useRouteMapData} / {@link prefetchRouteMap} instead of duplicating them.

 * itself, the same way comments and GPS export options are owned by the children that mount them.
 * All three are still covered by {@link prefetchRouteDetail}, on purpose — see its docblock.
 *
 * Auth also stays out: the page reads it via `team.role` (`isMember`), not `useAuth()`, but the
 * prefetch's GPS-services gate still goes through `useAuthStore.getState()`, matching the split
 * documented in SSR-data-loading.md.
