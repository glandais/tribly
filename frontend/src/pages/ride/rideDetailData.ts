 * calls {@link useRideDetailData} for the query results, the `ride-detail` route in
 * `routes.config.ts` calls {@link prefetchRideDetail} for the same data server-side. Describing it
 * twice is what this file exists to prevent: a divergence doesn't break anything visibly, it just
 * yields a different query key, so the client refetches after hydration and only
 * the prefetch audit of
 * `e2e/routes-render.e2e.ts` notices.
 *
 * Its own module rather than exports of `RideDetailPage.tsx`: `routes.config.ts` is imported
 * eagerly and must not pull the page out of its lazy chunk (same contract as
 * `pages/home/nextRideParams.ts` and `components/common/placeAutocompleteParams.ts`).

 * exact set from its `mapItems`, sort included) and the prefetch. The page used to derive
 * `group.routeSlug || ride.routeSlug` instead, which differs from the map's set as soon as a ride
 * with its own route has groups that name theirs — two keys, two `/routes/bulk` requests, and a
