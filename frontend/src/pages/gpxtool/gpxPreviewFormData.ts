/**
 * The one description of what `EditGpxPreviewPage` reads, consumed two ways: the page calls
 * {@link useGpxPreviewFormData} for the query result, the `gpx-tools-edit` route in
 * `routes.config.ts` calls {@link prefetchGpxPreviewForm} for the same data server-side. Same
 * contract as `pages/gpxtool/gpxPreviewData.ts` (which serves the sibling view/map routes) — kept
 * as its own module rather than an export of that file, since a sibling change there shouldn't have
 * to touch this route's wiring, and rather than an export of the page, since `routes.config.ts`
 * imports companions eagerly and must not pull the page out of its lazy chunk.
 *
 * Editing is owner-only, gated in the page itself (`!preview.owned` redirects to the read view) —
 * the query is the same `getPreview` the public view/map routes prefetch, just reached through an
 * authenticated route. The prefetch gates on `useAuthStore.getState().isAuthenticated` (the server
 * has no hook — see `pages/auth/profileData.ts`) so an anonymous visitor hitting the URL directly
 * doesn't prefetch anything the auth guard will redirect away from anyway.
