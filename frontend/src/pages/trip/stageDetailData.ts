 * `StageDetailPage` calls {@link useStageDetailData} for the query results, the `stage-detail`
 * route in `routes.config.ts` calls {@link prefetchStageDetail} for the same data server-side.
 * Same contract as `pages/ride/rideDetailData.ts` — its own module so `routes.config.ts`, which
 * imports it eagerly, doesn't pull the page out of its lazy chunk.
 *
 * The interesting derivation is the stage's route slug: it only exists inside the parent trip's
 * `stages` array, so both the page and the prefetch have to look it up the *same* way — one
 * `.find(s => s.slug === stageSlug)` away from `trip.stages`. Divergence here would server-render
 * the wrong route, or none.
