/**
 * Brings the e2e stack to a known state before the suite: a password for each role, and the shared
 * data every test may rely on.
 *
 * No session is saved for the tests to share: the refresh token rotates at every refresh
 * (docs/LEDGER_*.md SEC-27), and a token shared by several tests turns into a replay — which revokes
 * the session — as soon as one of them refreshes. Each browser context and each worker signs in on
 * its own instead (fixtures.ts `as`, data.ts `roleSession`), by password, which nothing rate-limits
 * but failures; hence a password for the admin too, whom the bootstrap creates without one.
 *
 * Idempotent: on a stack that already went through it, the logins succeed and nothing is redone.
 * Tests create their own data on top of this; nothing here is meant to be modified by a test.
