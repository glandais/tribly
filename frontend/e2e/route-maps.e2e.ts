/**
 * The five screens that draw a route's COMPLETE trace (docs/NEXT.md §1.2): route detail, the
 * route's full-screen map, stage detail and the stage's full-screen map (all four through
 * `useGetRoute`), and a ride's group map (`RoutesMapView`, through `useRoutesBulk` WITHOUT
 * `geometry: false`).
 *
 * One route, uploaded as a GPX written here, backs all of them: a stage of a trip rides it, and so
 * does the group of a ride. For each screen the test proves that
 *  - every read of the route the page made — sent from the browser, or prefetched by the SSR server
 *    and handed over in the page — asked for the full geometry (no `geometry=false`, nor any other
 *    parameter) and carried every stored vertex, and that those vertices follow the uploaded track
 *    end to end;
 *  - MapLibre actually drew it: the map canvas shows the trace's colours on a stubbed basemap.
 *
 * Nothing depends on routing (valhalla): the route comes from a GPX, not from the planner.
