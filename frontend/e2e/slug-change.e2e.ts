 * Changing a slug — the URL of a team, a ride, a route or an ad — from its edit form's
 * `SlugEditor`, and what becomes of the links already shared: the backend keeps a redirect from
 * every old slug (`TeamSlugRedirect`, `TeamEntitySlugRedirect`), so the old URL still leads to the
 * entity. An old team slug is redirected by the server (301, so a crawler without JavaScript moves
 * too); an old entity slug is rendered, and the page replaces it with the new one
 * (`useCanonicalPath`). A link in a chat, an ICS feed or a mobile deeplink must never end on a 404.
 *
 * One scenario per kind of entity, the same for all four: a malformed slug is refused on the page
 * without a request, a taken one by the API (409), and a new one replaces the URL; then a plain
 * member follows the old links. Every test builds its own owner (never a platform admin), team and
