# End-to-end tests

Playwright, against the **real application**: the SSR frontend and the backend images behind
traefik, with postgres, MinIO, imgproxy and mailpit — the deployment's `docker-compose.yml` plus the
`docker-compose.e2e.yml` overlay. Nothing is mocked: logins read their OTP and verification links
from mailpit, data is seeded through the REST API.

## Running

From the repository root:

```bash
scripts/e2e.sh up          # build the tribly-e2e images if missing, start, wait until it answers
scripts/e2e.sh test        # run the suite (any Playwright argument passes through)
scripts/e2e.sh reset       # empty database, files and saved sessions, then up
scripts/e2e.sh build frontend   # after a code change: rebuild an image, then `up` again
scripts/e2e.sh down
```

The app is on http://localhost:8190, mailpit on http://localhost:18025 — every port is offset from
the workstation stack (`tribly-local`), so both run side by side. `valhalla` and `tileserver` are
borrowed from the workstation stack's network; when it is down the e2e stack still starts, but
routing and map tiles fail.

From `frontend/`: `pnpm e2e` (same as `scripts/e2e.sh test`), `pnpm e2e:ui` (Playwright's UI mode),
`pnpm e2e:typecheck`. After a failure: `pnpm exec playwright show-report e2e/.report`, or
`show-trace` on the `trace.zip` the failure printed.

**Don't run the backend suite at the same time.** Its Testcontainers create and remove veth
interfaces on the host; Chromium reports `net::ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED` and fails to load chunks
(« Failed to fetch dynamically imported module »), which surfaces as random hydration timeouts.
Under load, `--workers=5` is steadier than the default.

**Parallel runs need distinct output dirs.** Playwright empties its output directory (traces,
screenshots) when a run starts, so two runs sharing one wipe each other's failure traces.
Give each its own: `E2E_OUTPUT=/tmp/e2e-mine pnpm e2e`, or `--output=/tmp/e2e-mine`.

**The tests run against images, not your working tree** — rebuild (`scripts/e2e.sh build frontend`
or `backend`, about a minute each) and `up` before testing a change. `E2E_BASE_URL` and
`E2E_MAILPIT_URL` override where the suite looks, but the stack behind them must be one whose
bootstrap admin is `admin@e2e.test` — not the workstation stack.

## In CI

`.github/workflows/e2e.yml` runs the whole suite **every night on `develop`** and **on demand**
(Actions › E2E › Run workflow), never on pull requests. It builds both images on a GitHub-hosted
runner, starts this same stack with `scripts/e2e.sh up`, and uploads the report, the traces and the
stack's logs when something fails. There is no valhalla there: `E2E_NO_ROUTING=1` makes
`playwright.config.ts` skip `gpx-planner.e2e.ts`. The job's first step fails unless `.env.e2e` still
points the mailer at mailpit.

## Why a separate stack

The workstation database is a biketeam restore holding thousands of real member addresses, and a
test run sends OTPs and invitations. The e2e stack starts on an **empty** database, its mailer only
reaches mailpit, and `.env.e2e` holds nothing but throwaway values — which is why it is committed.

## Writing tests

- Files are `*.e2e.ts` (Vitest's glob would pick up `*.spec.ts`).
- Import `test`, `expect` and `as` from `./support/fixtures`. `test.use(as('rider'))` signs a block in
  as that role; the `seed` fixture says what `global-setup.ts` created (a public team with the
  platform admin as owner and the rider as member).
- **`test.use(as(role))` also signs in the API contexts of `support/api.ts`**: they inherit the
  `refresh_token` cookie, which the backend accepts (`getUserFromRefreshTokenCookie`). A call meant
  to be anonymous then runs as that role — sign the page in with `signIn(context, roleSession(…))`
  instead when a test mixes a signed-in page and anonymous API calls.
- **Never modify the seed from a test.** Create what the test needs, with a unique name, through
  `support/api.ts` — the suite runs fully parallel, on two projects (desktop and mobile).
- Type request bodies with the generated DTOs (`import type { … } from '../src/api/dto'`): a field
  the contract made required is then a type error instead of a 400 at run time.
- The app speaks French by default (`locale: 'fr-FR'`), so navigate with the French paths
  (`/connexion`, `/equipes/…`) — or with the English ones, which the router registers too.
- Prefer roles and accessible names (`getByRole('heading', { name })`) over text: the same text
  often appears in a breadcrumb that the mobile layout hides.

## Shared helpers

Everything a journey needs lives in `support/`, one module per domain, one implementation of each
helper — reuse before writing a new one, and keep journey-only helpers in their own
`support/<journey>.ts` (`flow-account.ts`, `flow-team.ts`, `routes-render.ts`, …).

- `api.ts` — `withApi(who, run)` (a disposable request context signed in as `who`, or anonymous),
  `apiGet` / `apiPost` / `apiPut` / `apiPatch` / `apiDelete` (parsed body, or an `ApiError` with the
  backend's `code`), `apiGetOrNull` (null on a 404: a deleted or unknown entity), `expectOk`, the
  logins and `refresh`.
- `data.ts` — `roleSession(role)` (cached per worker), `signIn(context, auth)`, `newUser`,
  `freshAddress` (an address with no account), `markdownMedia`, `teamRequest`, `newTeam` (applies
  the `enable*` flags POST ignores, and a non-TEAM visibility as the platform admin;
  `{ addMemberAllowed: true }` lets the team's admins add and invite), `getTeam`,
  `setTeamAttributes`, `addMember` (as the platform admin unless the team allows it), `newTeamPage`.
- `fixtures.ts` — `test`, `expect`, `as(role)`, the `seed` fixture, `unique(label)`.
- `rides.ts` — `rideRequest`, `newRide`, `readRide` / `findRide`, `readComments`, `readTemplates`,
  `joinGroup`, `postComments`, `openRide`, `groupCard`.
- `routes.ts` — `newRoute` (GPX upload), `getRoute`, `newTrip`, `fetchTrip` (null once deleted),
  the route/trip/stage paths, `stubBasemap`, `traceMapPixels`, `watchRouteReads`.
- `posts.ts` — `newPost`, `fetchPost` / `findPost`.
- `ads.ts` — `newAd` (with pictures), `getAd`, `uploadImage`, `solidPng`.
- `editor.ts` — the rich-text editor every form shares: `richText(scope, name?)` (by its accessible
  name, « Description » unless `EDITOR_LABEL` says otherwise), `typeRichText`, `toolbarButton`,
  `addImage`, and `letEditorSettle(page)` — lets its 150 ms debounce hand the text over. Saving
  needs no pause (the editor flushes on blur); removing an editor with an update queued does
  (needs `page.clock.install()` before the first `goto`).
- `dates.ts` — Paris wall-clock dates (`WallClock`, `parisWallClock`, `parisDaysAhead`,
  `parisInstant`, `pickerText`, `frenchDateTime`) and the Mantine DateTimePicker driver
  (`pickDateTime`, `openPicker`).
- `calendar.ts` — the team calendar on both layouts: `openCalendar(page, team, day)`,
  `calendarEvent`, `teamEvents`. Its events are SSR-prefetched, so an absence check needs another
  event of the same view shown first.
- `contract.ts` — `contractWebRoutes()` (contracts/routes.yaml), `configuredAuth()`
  (routes.config.ts), `fillPath`.
- `mailpit.ts` — `mailbox` + `waitForNewMail` (text of the next mail), `mailsTo` (headers and every
  part), `otpCodeIn`, `linkTokenIn`.
- `ui.ts` — `hydrated(locator)` before clicking a server-rendered control, `pageHydrated`,
  `watchHydration` (hydration errors, uncaught page errors, discarded server markup), `toasts`,
  `watchToasts` (every toast shown, where a retrying `toHaveCount(0)` would pass vacuously),
  `pageAs(browser, auth)` (a second browser with the project's device — never a bare
  `browser.newContext()`), `entityCard`, `actionsMenu` / `openActionsMenu` (a detail page's
  « Options de gestion » chevron), `escapeRegExp`, `startsWith`.
- `stack.ts` — where the e2e stack answers (`stack`, read from `.env.e2e`; `E2E_BASE_URL` /
  `E2E_MAILPIT_URL` override it), `storageStatePath`, `seedPath`.
- `domains.ts` — multi-tenancy: `hostHeader`, `onHost` / `hostGet` / `hostPost` / `hostPut` /
  `hostStatus`, `registerOn` / `loginOn` / `signInOn`, `otherDomain`, `newTeamOn`, `pinnedTeam`,
  `pinnedAlias`, `hostDocument`, `plannerSite`.
- `ssr.ts` — the server-rendered document without a browser: `rawDocument`, `ssrOutlet`,
  `reactQueryState` / `dehydratedQuery`, `ogTags`, `authState`, `sessionCookie`.
- `list-pages.ts` — URL-driven list pages ([docs/URL_FILTERS.md](../docs/URL_FILTERS.md)): `watchListReads`,
  `openServerRendered`, `expectInMarkup`, `expectQuery`, `nextPage`, `expectCurrentPage`.
- `invitations.ts` — `inviteByApi`, `invitationTokenIn`, `previewInvitation`, `membershipsOf`.
- `member-directory.ts` — `directoryTeam` (one account per role, none a platform admin),
  `setMemberDirectory`, `listMembers`.
- `platform-admin.ts` — the admin screens and their API: team/user/domain rows, `setPlatformRole`,
  `toggleTeamArchived`, domain aliases (`aliasesOf`, `deleteAlias`), `gpsCredentialsOf`,
  `scratchDomain`, `betaSignups`.
- `moderation.ts` — `report`, `blockedBy`, `teamQueue` / `platformQueue`, `moderationWorld`,
  `queueCard`, `queueTab`, `commentRow`.
- `notifications.ts` — a user's inbox and preferences through the API: `listNotifications`,
  `unreadCount`, `waitForNotification` (the dispatcher's wait), `expectNoNotification`,
  `notificationPreferences`, `isMuted`.
- `device.ts` — the Karoo/Garmin device code flow: `startDeviceFlow`, `verifyUserCode`,
  `pollToken` / `pollError`, `refreshDeviceToken`, `deviceMe`, `jwtClaims`.
- `ad-contact.ts` — the classified-ad e-mail relay: `setContactable`, `contactAuthor`, `rawAd`.
- `scheduled-publication.ts` — scheduled posts and trips: `pickIntoEmptyPicker`, `pastPublishAt`,
  `waitForAutoPublish`.
- `slug-change.ts` — renaming a team, ride, route or ad URL with `SlugEditor` and the redirects kept
  from old slugs: `slugScene`, `renameThroughApi`, `readAt`, `slugEditor`, `freshSlug`.
- `pwa.ts` — the installable site: `waitForServiceWorker`, `cacheNames`, `manifestOf`,
  `installPromptDouble` / `fireInstallPrompt`, `watchFirebase`.

## How sessions work

**The refresh token rotates at every refresh** (ledger `SEC-27`): the refresh answers with a new
token, the one presented is honoured for another minute, and presented after that it is taken for a
stolen copy and **revokes the session**. The browser refreshes on every document (the SSR server
does, and hands it the new cookie). So a session has **one owner** — the test, or one browser
context — and never a token saved and shared:

- `global-setup.ts` saves no session. It gives each role a password (the bootstrap admin, created
  without one, gets it once through the mailed reset link) and writes it to the seed; password
  logins are only rate-limited on failures.
- `as(role)` logs a fresh session in for each context; `roleSession(role)` logs one in per worker,
  at most every 10 minutes.
- `signIn(context, auth)` gives the browser **a session of its own** whenever `auth` carries its
  password (`newUser()`, `roleSession()`, `registerOn()`), the test keeping `auth`'s. Otherwise
  the browser takes `auth`'s session over, and the test must stop refreshing it.
- To read the browser's session, pass the context: `meFromSession(context)`,
  `sessionIsAlive(context)` write the rotated token back into its cookie. With an AuthResponse,
  `refreshHeld(auth)` / `meFromSession(auth)` keep it in the object; `rawDocument`/`hostDocument`
  do the same for a cookie built by `sessionCookie(auth)`. A bare token string can be refreshed
  once.
