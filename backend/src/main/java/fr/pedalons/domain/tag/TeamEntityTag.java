/**
 * A tag on a ride, a post, a trip, a route or an ad — the five live in {@code team_entities}, so one
 * link table serves them all. That the tag's type matches the content's, and that both belong to
 * the same team, is {@code TagService}'s job, not the schema's.
 *
 * <p>Hard delete; the row's presence is the tagging. Deliberately no collection on {@code
 * TeamEntity}: a list resolves its tags per page through {@code TagLookup}, never by walking a lazy
 * collection row by row.
