/**
 * One forecast location of the weather cache: a 0.05° cell (~5 km), plus a 100 m elevation band when
 * the point it stands for has a known altitude.
 *
 * <p><b>Global, with no {@code domainId}</b> — the explicit exception to the rule that every query
 * filters by domain (see the package documentation): a forecast depends on a place and an hour only,
 * and a cell is only ever read starting from a ride the caller may already read. The coordinates
 * stored are the centre of the cell, which is also what the provider is asked about: a meeting
 * point never leaves the server more precisely than the cell.
 *
 * <p>Standalone (no {@code BaseEntity}): nobody creates a cell, the planner does. Never persisted
 * through JPA either: {@code WeatherCellRepository} upserts it natively, because two planners of a
 * rolling deploy may want the same cell at the same moment. The unique key {@code (lat_idx,
 * lon_idx, ele_band) NULLS NOT DISTINCT} lives in {@code V61__weather_cache.sql} and, for the tests
 * (built from the entities), in {@code import-test.sql}: an annotation cannot say {@code NULLS NOT
 * DISTINCT}.
