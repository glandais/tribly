/**
 * What the confirmation page shows before anyone has signed in: the request as biketeam signed it,
 * and what it would land on here. Nothing beyond what the signed request already says, plus the
 * name of the existing team it would land on or conflict with — which the team's public page shows anyway.
 *
 * <p>No class-level {@code @Schema}: SmallRye adds every type annotated with it to the OpenAPI
 * components, and the biketeam migration endpoints are hidden from the contract. The field-level
 * {@code required} flags stay, for {@link ValidateSchema}. Mirrored by hand in the frontend's
 * pages/biketeamMigration/biketeamMigrationApi.ts.
