/**
 * A team's « Tableau de bord », for one of its members or for a visitor, in one response.
 *
 * <p>Every section is a short page (five rows at most) built by the same services and per-page
 * lookups as the lists it previews, so its rows are the rows those lists show and its {@code total}
 * is what « Voir tout » opens. A section is null when the team has turned its module off; the
 * organizer and admin blocks are null below their role. A visitor (null role) gets the public
 * sections only — docs/LEDGER_*.md API-86.
