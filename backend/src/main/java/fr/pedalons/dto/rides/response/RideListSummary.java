 * @param maxParticipants the sum of the groups' capacities, or {@code null} when the ride has no
 *     group or at least one uncapped group — the same rides {@code full} can never be true for
 * @param groups every group of the ride, in sort order
 * @param firstGroupRoute the route metrics of the first group (in sort order) that has a route —
 *     what the row shows when the ride itself has no route. Null when no group has one.
