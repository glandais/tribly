/**
 * What the current user is registered to, among a known set of rides and trips, loaded once for a
 * whole page (or once for a single detail row).
 *
 * <p>This is the "me" half of a publication payload: {@code registered} and {@code
 * registeredGroupId} depend on who is asking, while {@link PublicationListSummaries} does not.
 * Keeping the two apart is what lets the summaries stay a pure per-entity aggregate.
 *
 * <p>Built by {@code fr.pedalons.service.common.ParticipationLookup}, which resolves the current
 * user itself — an anonymous caller gets {@link #NONE} and every "me" field reads false/null rather
 * than failing.
 *
 * @param registeredGroupIdByRideId ride id → the group of that ride the user joined; a ride absent
 *     from the map is a ride the user did not join
 * @param registeredTripIds the trip ids the user joined
 * @param registeredGroupByRideId ride id → the joined group, rendered — filled only on the list
 *     path, where a row has no {@code groups} to find it in (docs/LEDGER_*.md API-4); empty
 *     elsewhere
