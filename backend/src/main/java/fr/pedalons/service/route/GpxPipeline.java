/**
 * The geometry pipeline, shared by every producer of a track: resample, fix and smooth elevation,
 * simplify. One place so route import, GPX previews and the planner cannot drift apart.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately free of {@code java.nio.file}: {@link Path} here is vcyclist's immutable point
 * array, and the collision with {@code java.nio.file.Path} is contained by never importing both in
 * the same file. Each step returns a <b>new</b> {@link Path}; nothing is mutated, which is what
 * lets a caller keep the raw geometry and the processed one side by side.
 *
 * <p>Every constant below is inherited from gpx2web, not chosen:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code 0.5 / 10.0} — points closer than 0.5 m are dropped, gaps over 10 m are densified.
 *       Raising the minimum to 10 m would drop far more points and shorten every route.
 *   <li>{@code smoothElevation(p, 150.0)} is <b>not optional</b>: gpx2web's elevation fixer set the
 *       elevations <em>and then</em> smoothed over a 150 m window. vcyclist splits the two, so
 *       skipping the second call would change the elevation gain of every route.
 *   <li>{@code simplify(p, 3.0, 3.0)} — gpx2web's Douglas-Peucker tolerance, with the same ×3
 *       vertical exaggeration its ECEF projection applied.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code fixElevationBlocking} parks the calling thread for the whole elevation fetch (it is a
 * bare {@code runBlocking}; the hop onto the IO dispatcher happens inside the tile fetcher). That
 * is harmless here because the pipeline runs under {@code @Transactional(NOT_SUPPORTED)}, so no DB
 * connection is held while it blocks.
