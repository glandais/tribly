/**
 * The date or meeting point of a published ride changed. Carries the state <em>before</em> the
 * change: the resolver compares it with the ride as it is by then, so an edit undone before the
 * dispatch notifies nobody, and several edits in a row notify once, of their net effect.
 *
 * <p>Keyed by the ride alone, and that key is only held while the event waits — see {@link
 * #coalescesWhilePending()}. The first edit's row wins the {@code ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING}, so the
 * state it carries is the one before the whole series.
