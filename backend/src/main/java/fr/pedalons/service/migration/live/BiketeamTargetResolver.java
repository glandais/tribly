/**
 * What a biketeam team would land on in a domain — docs/plans/2026-09-22-biketeam-live-migration.md
 * §7.3. The same rules are evaluated at preview, at confirmation and by the job, since the state can
 * change between the three.
 *
 * <p>Two facts decide, in this order: {@code m}, the team the {@code TEAM} mapping row of {@code
 * teamId} points at, and only when {@code m} is not a live team of the domain, {@code t}, the team at
 * the target slug ({@link #targetSlug}) in the domain, trash included ({@code uk_teams_domain_slug}
 * spans trashed teams). The mapping comes first: a migrated team keeps being that team whatever its
 * slug has become on Pédalons. A team is only ever touched when {@code m} points at it — never a
 * native team.
 *
 * <p>Callers run inside a transaction.
