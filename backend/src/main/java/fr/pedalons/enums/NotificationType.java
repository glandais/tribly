/**
 * The closed set of things a member can be notified about.
 *
 * <p>Stored by name in {@code notification_events.type} and {@code notification_preferences.type}:
 * renaming a constant is a data migration, adding one is not. Each constant has exactly one event
 * record in {@code fr.pedalons.service.notification.event}, and the resolver switches exhaustively
 * over those records — a type added here without its handling does not compile.
 *
 * <p>{@link #defaultChannels} is what a member receives until they touch their preferences. Only
 * the overrides are stored, so changing a default here changes it for everyone who never did.
