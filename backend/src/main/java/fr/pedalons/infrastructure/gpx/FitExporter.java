 * the two GPX serializations, and the Wahoo upload builds one on the fly because Wahoo's {@code POST
 * /v1/routes} takes a FIT payload and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>{@code startTime} is mandatory (FIT has no relative clock) and reproduces gpx2web's choice: the
 * first point's own timestamp, which is epoch 0 — 1970-01-01 — for a route that carries no time. The
 * library rebases each path onto that start itself; rebasing here too would overwrite every
 * timestamp.
