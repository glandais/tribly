/**
 * @param status narrows the listing to a single status. This <b>intersects</b> the visibility rules
 *     applied by {@code TeamEntityRepository.getPedalonsQuery}; it never widens them, so asking for
 *     {@code DRAFT} as a plain member still yields nothing.
 * @param participating keep only the publications the user of {@link #userId()} is registered to.
 *     Yields nothing for an anonymous caller, the same way {@link #minRole()} does.
 * @param ascending order by {@code dateTime} ascending instead of the default descending — what "my
 *     next outing" needs.
 * @param tagIds keep only the publications carrying at least one of these tags (plan D6). Set by
 *     a team's dedicated list only — the rides, the posts or the trips of one team — never by the
 *     mixed feed nor by a cross-team list (plan D7, D13). Null or empty: no filter.
 * @param withoutRoute keep only the rides with no route at all: none on the ride itself, none on any
 *     of its groups. Drops every other type of publication.
 * @param withFullGroup keep only the rides with at least one group at capacity. Drops every other
 *     type of publication.
