# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Pedalons: multi-tenant cycling team platform (rides, routes with GPX/maps, posts). Contract-first API development.

Each module has its own `CLAUDE.md` with commands, architecture, and gotchas — it loads automatically when you work with files in that directory:
[backend/](backend/CLAUDE.md) · [frontend/](frontend/CLAUDE.md) · [mobile/](mobile/CLAUDE.md) · [karoo/](karoo/CLAUDE.md) · [garmin-app/](garmin-app/CLAUDE.md)

See [BRANDING.md](BRANDING.md) for logo, icon assets, brand colors, and full theme reference.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|-------------|
| Backend | Java 21, Quarkus 3.30.x, PostgreSQL 17 + PostGIS, Hibernate/Panache, Flyway |
| Frontend | TypeScript 5 (tsgo for type checking), React 19, Vite 8, Mantine UI, Zustand, React Query |
| Mobile | Flutter, Dart (see `mobile/rules.md` for detailed guidelines) |
| Karoo | Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, karoo-ext SDK, ktor-client-karoo |
| Auth | Database auth with JWT (password, OTP, passkeys/WebAuthn) |
| IDs | TSID via hypersistence-utils (Long internally, lowercase string in API) |
| API | OpenAPI 3.1 contract-first with code generation |

## Infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d               # PostgreSQL + imgproxy + valhalla
docker compose --profile tools up  # + pgAdmin + Mailhog
```

Deployed hosts are laid out differently: one shared stack (`docker-compose.shared.yml` — valhalla and
tileserver, on the `pedalons-shared` network) plus one `docker-compose.yml` stack per environment.
See [Deployment](README.md#deployment) before touching networks or the compose files.

## Multi-Tenancy

- **Domain-based isolation**: Each HTTP domain has its own teams/users. Same email can exist on different domains.
- **Domain resolution**: `DomainResolver` extracts domain from `X-Forwarded-Host` → `Host` header → finds `Domain` entity
- **Domain entity**: Stores `domain` (hostname), `name`, `baseUrl`. WebAuthn/email settings derived from Domain.
- **All queries must filter by domainId**: Use `pedalonsQueryContext.getDomainId()` in query builders
- **Tests**: Call `dataService.getOrCreateDefaultDomain()` + `domainResolver.setDomainForTest(domain)` in setUp()

## Contract-First Workflow

**API contract**: use the `contract-first-api` skill after modifying backend REST resources or DTOs.

**UI routes contract**: `contracts/routes.yaml` is the single source of truth (multi-locale path templates, deeplink/mobile flags). Edit it, then run `pnpm generate-routes` in frontend/ to regenerate `paths.generated.ts`, `paths.generated.dart`, the apple-app-site-association file, and the deeplink section of `AndroidManifest.xml`. Never hand-edit those. See [APP_LINKS.md](APP_LINKS.md).

## Critical Prohibitions

- **Never run backend tests yourself** — give instructions to the user instead. You're bad at fixing tests from test outcomes.
