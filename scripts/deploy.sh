#
# Never run `docker stack deploy` by hand on this file, for two reasons this script exists for:
#
#   - `docker stack deploy` reads no .env. Every ${VAR} of docker-compose.yml would expand to an
#     empty string, and only the few spelled `${VAR:?}` would stop it. The shared stack is no
#     exception: a VALHALLA_TILE_URLS set in its .env and silently replaced by the default costs a
#     rebuild of several hours.
#   - backend and frontend run the image tagged with a commit (scripts/_image_tag.sh), which this
#     script picks. A new tag is a new service spec, which Swarm rolls out start-first: the old task
#     serves until the new one is healthy, and a new task that never gets there is rolled back. The
#     script waits for that outcome (DEPLOY_TIMEOUT, 600s by default) and exits non-zero on a rollback.
#
# The stack is named after ENV_NAME, not after the checkout: scripts/backup.sh and restore.sh find
# its containers and volumes (${ENV_NAME}_postgres_data...) by that name.
